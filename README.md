The full-stack app shows relationship between people and can add people and relaitonships to a database. By choosing two people it will show the relationship between selected people. if they are not directly related it will show degrees of separation for example: if Dave and Ryan have a mutual friend named John. it will show Dave > John > Ryan. It will also show more complicated relationships. If two people have a few people between them the app can show. Dave > John > Brad > Ryan.
